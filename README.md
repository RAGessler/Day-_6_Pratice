The last line on each probelm is the command to run the function.  just uncomment the line and run.
Any list will work with any function that uses a list. feel free to test it out. 



Worksheet 2 info:
problem 1
1. create a new empty varible that will be returned
2. Find out how many characters are in a string.
3. use a loop to take the last character of the given string and make it the next character of the new varible.
4. return the new varible and print

problem 2
1. make a user input for a string
2. find out how many words are in that string.
3. use a loop to capitalize each word of that string and place them back into a variable.

Problem 3
1. make a string input = a variable
2. find the length of that variable
3. ceate a for loop that reversed that varaible and uses it to create a new one (see problem 1)
3. check to see if reversed variable = input variable


Bonus Challenge.
1. Create a user input for a string
2. create an empty string variable
3. make a variable that contains the length of the input string -1
4. make a counter for how many time a string repeats
5. use a for loop that runs the length of the input string and checks every item in the string.
6. using an if statement, check to see if the variable[index] == variable[index+1]
if it does, it will add one to the counter.
if it does not, it will add that string to the new string variable plus whatever is on the counter and move on to the next string.
